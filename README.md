# Revitalize Hub
Winning project of Monash Industry Experience EXPO, Team: TP19. 

## Project Overview				
Victoria is currently facing the crisis of youth homelessness, 20% of people experiencing homelessness in Victoria are aged between 18 and 24. Particularly young adults are feeling worried about being homeless due to financial hardship. And financial difficulty is one of the main reasons for their homelessness.

Revitalize Hub is a website which aims to prevent young Victorians from being homeless. The core ideas of the website include helping young Victorians find the help they need, helping them find a better suburb to live in and developing their budgeting habits to enhance their ability to manage their finances.
