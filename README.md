# Revitalize Hub
This is a project for FIT5120 - Industry Experience, Team: TP19. 

## Project Overview				
Victoria is currently facing the crisis of youth homelessness, 20% of people experiencing homelessness in Victoria are aged between 18 and 24. Particularly young adults are feeling worried about being homeless due to financial hardship. And financial difficulty is one of the main reasons for their homelessness.

Revitalize Hub is a website which aims to prevent young Victorians from being homeless. The core ideas of the website include helping young Victorians find the help they need, helping them find a better suburb to live in and developing their budgeting habits to enhance their ability to manage their finances.
Revitalize Hub provides several functions:

- **View Trends**: Introduce the current state of Victoria's homeless population, showcase relevant positive trends.
- **Find Services**: Display specific information about the helping center and supporting organizations that can provide help to users. 
- **Suburbs Livability**: Search for a specific suburb and check its livability level regarding its median rent, distance to support services and crime rate.
- **Budget Now**: Make an online budget plan and generate an expenses report.
